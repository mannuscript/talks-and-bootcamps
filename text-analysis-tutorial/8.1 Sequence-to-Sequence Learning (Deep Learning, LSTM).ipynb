    "# Machine Translation (Deep Learning, LSTM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Translation is a sequence-to-sequence task, where the input is one sequence and the output is another sequences. Sequence-to-sequence tasks have seen a great improvement with the advent of Deep Learning. Various network models have been proposed and are still proposed for further improvements. In this tutorial, we rely on recurrent network models (in more detail: LSTMs). The connection between the two models can be sketched as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "The left LSTM network, the encoder, reads the input sequence. The hidden states of the LSTM cell is the copied to the decoder (righthand-side network), which uses this state to generate the new sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** In this tutorial we translate keyword-based queries into the corresponding questions in proper English. Each query is about a restaurant or a hotel, and we assume that each restaurant or hotel name has already been exracted using NER and replaced with `<POI>` (point of interest). This is a common step for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Named entities often contain words that are not in the dictionary. Excluding them makes the vocabulary significantly smaller, thus easier for the network to train.\n",
    "* Named entities -- here the names of restaurant and hotels -- are usually not translated anyway"
